# Pip The Mover

Note:

Pip The Mover is a code test I did for a company to show off my skills. Im quite happy with the work I did on this especially the unit tests therefore I've decided to post this on my repo. I've changed some of the text to make it hard to find so others cant use this to cheat the code test given by the aforementioned company.
